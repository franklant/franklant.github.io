            <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out 
            walking once more. <span class="underline-text">I felt deeply 
            moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile 
            treasure.</span> <span class="highlight-text">It seemed to me, 
            even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the 
            moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair
            that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class="red-bold-text">
            "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is the most important is invisible..."
            </span> As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said
            to myself, again: <span class="red-bold-text">"What moves me so deeply, about
            this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image
            of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even
            when he is asleep . . ."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
            <span class="underline-text">I felt the need of protecting him, 
            as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .
